 @brief Defines the data structures to keep track of memory resources of
 executing user programs (address spaces).

 The constructor of this class takes as parameter an ELF executable
 file and loads it in the RAM of the (simulated) MIPS processor. This
 part will be modified in the virtual memory assignment to implement
 demand paging (on-demand loading of code/data).
